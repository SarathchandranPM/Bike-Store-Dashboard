## Bike Shop Sales Analytics Dashboard

This data analytics project showcases end-to-end data processing and visualization for a bike retail business. The implementation begins with SQL data integration, where three CSV datasets are combined using UNION and JOIN operations to create a comprehensive dataset spanning 2021-2022. The resulting SQL query is then connected directly to Power BI for visualization.

The dashboard provides multi-dimensional analysis through various interactive visualizations:
- Matrix visualization showing hourly sales distribution across weekdays
- Seasonal revenue breakdown through bar charts
- Comparative monthly analysis of riders across two years with profit and revenue trends
- Customer segmentation analysis (casual vs. registered riders)
- Key performance indicators including profit margin calculations using DAX

The project demonstrates proficiency in:
- SQL data integration (UNION and JOIN operations)
- Power BI and MySQL database connectivity
- Advanced visualization techniques
- DAX calculations for financial metrics
- Interactive dashboard design
